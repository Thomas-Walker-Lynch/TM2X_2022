File names ending .lib.c  are compiled into a library.
Files names ending in .cli.c  are compiled for invocation from the command line.
File names ending in .isq.c  are instruction sequence source code.

We do not use separate header files.  Instead source code is separated into sections using
macros.

In the .isq.c file you will see:

#if defined(DECLARATION)
  // stuff that used to go into a header file
#endif 

#if defined(DEFINITION)
  // our sequence stuff, has no analog in old code
#endif
